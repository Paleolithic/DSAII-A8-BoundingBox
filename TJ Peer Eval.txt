Peer Eval for Jared Simonelli

Jared was an exceptional teammate, if there was a scale I would give him a 10 out of 10, 10 being the highest... 
He was good to bounce ideas off of and we hardly ever disagreed with the direction we should be going on the homework.
We basically both did half of the work each. No complaints.
